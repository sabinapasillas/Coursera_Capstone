    "A friend of mine is moving to the city of Los Angeles to open an Indian restaurant. I have decided to help her choose what community in Los Angeles she should start her business. She has a few requirements including an area with a high volume of foot traffic which could translate to a more business centered area than residential. She also would not like to be near other Indian restaurants. Lastly, she does not want to work too far from where she lives. She will be moving to Mar Vista and would want to be within a 10 mile radius from her home."
